excerpt: 'We introduce clipped first-order methods for solving non-monotone generalized smoothn variational inequalities, establishing the first convergence guarantees for gradient descent-ascent, extragarient, and optimistic methods that match or improve upon standard smooth rates. We also propose extragradient method with backtracking line-search that matches the same rates wihtout additional knoledge on the parameters.'
